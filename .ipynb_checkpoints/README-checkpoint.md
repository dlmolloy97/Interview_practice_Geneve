# Interview_practice_Geneve

This mini-project was intended to strengthen the author's use of Dash, incorporating Folium and multiple inputs, and was completed as part of Codecademy's interview practice course. AirBNB data was used to create a map of the city of Geneva, Switzerland, with input that enables the user to filter listings by their nightly rate, while setting a total budget limit and length of trip. The principal libraries used were Pandas (to load, explore and filter the dataframe), Folium and Branca (to create and color-code the map) and Dash. A future version of this project will be completed in ReactJS.
